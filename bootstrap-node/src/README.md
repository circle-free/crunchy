# Bootstrap Node

Includes:
- Node.js chat application code so that you can chat with the Bootstrap node.
- A WebRTC Signaling Server, that is used in the browser example.

**Important!**: If you are running through the example with others, only 1 person should run the Bootstrap Node.

## Run
1. Install the node modules if you have not already done so from the [../nodejs](../nodejs) folder, `npm clean-install`.
1. Run the Bootstrap server, `node index.js`
